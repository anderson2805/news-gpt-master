Dr Ng met with the Defence Ministers of many countries and said that all countries could unanimously agree that conflicts in Asia were completely avoidable and no issue should be resolved with violence, but with diplomacy instead. Dr Ng believed that there would not be immediate conflicts in Asia, but some of the actions between the US and China could be seen as prepositioning actions and the countries should do their best to avoid the situation from escalating. (Phoenix New Media is a China-based news site.)\nDefence Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen reaffirmed defence ties with his counterparts at the Munich Security Conference. Dr Ng held bilateral engagements with Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur, Netherlands Defence Minister Kajsa Ollongren, UK Secretary of State for Defence Ben Wallace, Australian Minister for Defence Industry, International Development and the Pacific Pat Conroy, and Minister and Deputy Chairman of China\u2019s Foreign Affairs Committee of the 13th China National People's Congress Fu Ying. Dr Ng reaffirmed the warm and growing defence relations between Singapore and Germany with German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius and expressed appreciation for Germany's support for the SAF's training in Germany since 2009. At the Maritime Security Roundtable, Dr Ng described the current situation with rising tensions between the US and China as not a comfortable place, and stressed that the Asia region did not need conflict and that issues could be settled diplomatically without resorting to violence. Dr Ng said that there was consensus that a simultaneous war in Europe and a conflict in Asia would be disastrous for the world.\nDefence Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen said that de-escalation was key to Asia's security at the MSC.

Any cross-strait conflict between China and Taiwan (and the US) would derail economic growth and imperil regional stability. There was little appetite among Southeast Asians to see China achieve its re-unification with Taiwan through forceful means. Singapore might have to consider whether to grant access to US forces headed to the Taiwan Strait if hostilities broke out between China and Taiwan. Not doing so might seriously rupture Singapore\u2019s longstanding bilateral relationship with the US, but granting access could be a divisive domestic issue while angering China. The increased tensions over the Taiwan Strait had forced more Southeast Asians in the foreign policy-security establishment to start thinking the unthinkable and to stop seeing a Taiwan Strait contingency from a parochial mindset.

Instead of feeling sorry for himself, he focused on becoming a better leader as a sergeant and eventually got an overseas scholarship at the end of his NS career. 3SG Lim also mentioned that it was a matter of perspective \u2014 if people considered NS to be a waste of time, then NS would feel like a waste of time for them.",

Analysts said that the unpredictability of conflict posed a formidable question to Beijing \u2013 how to win a war swiftly and decisively.

        "contentdescription":"A commentary on India's BrahMos missile sales to Southeast Asia was written by Dr Ian Storey. Primarily an anti-ship missile, BrahMos could be launched from the sea, under the sea, on land and in the air. Though Manila would never say so explicitly, its BrahMos was clearly bought with China in mind, as the two countries had been locked in a tense territorial dispute in the South China Sea for decades. Other Southeast Asian countries were reportedly in talks to buy BrahMos: Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and Myanmar. India appeared to be on the verge of selling BrahMos systems to one or more of those countries \u2013 most likely Indonesia or Vietnam. BrahMos missile sales to Southeast Asian states also garnered geopolitical pluses for New Delhi as it would complicate Beijing\u2019s expansionist policy in the South China Sea. China was probably displeased about Southeast Asian countries acquiring such a potent deterrent. Any support that India could provide to the Southeast Asian claimants to prevent Beijing from flexing its military muscle in the South China Sea was likely viewed in Washington with quiet satisfaction.

Public Service Commission Overseas Merit Scholarship Recipient Terence Ho said: \u201cScholarships have always been a route by which potential public sector leaders are identified, but it\u2019s important that this is not the only route and it\u2019s important to ensure that the so-called \u2018farmers\u2019 or those who don\u2019t come through the scholarship route would also have sufficient opportunities to learn, grow on the job, demonstrate their potential and eventually, also rise to the top.\u201d The terms were used to delineate a perceived bifurcation of the officer corps into \u201cscholars\u201d, namely those who received top university scholarships overseas, and the \u201cfarmers\u201d who either do not have a university degree or had studied locally. Dr Samuel Chan, author of Aristocracy of Armed Talent: The Military Elite in Singapore, said: \u201cIt is good to look at meritocracy in the military, because the military is perhaps a microcosm of wider society in terms of the practice of meritocracy.\u201d While scholarships provided the advantages of a springboard into the career, having a scholarship did not guarantee success as meritocracy, fundamentally in the civil service, had to be both performance-based and subjected to peer-appraisal. In response to the question on why former military generals were posted to various positions in the government sector or private sector, Dr Chan said: \u201cAs a general, you have lots of responsibility, you are overseeing hundreds of millions of dollars in budgets, and so you have proven leadership ability and also responsibility.\u201d",
