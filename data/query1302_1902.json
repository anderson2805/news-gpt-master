        "contentdescription":"Total Defence (TD), which was first introduced in 1984, would see further changes in the future and it was important that all Singaporeans cooperated and remained prepared for it. Singapore introduced NS to strengthen our military defence and protect our country against issues such as global tensions and uncertainty in regional security. Air Operations and Systems Expert ME2 Shailaja said that her family, many of whom had served or were currently serving in various military services, had supported Total Defence and ensured Singapore\u2019s defence was not compromised. With regards to digital threats, N Sridharan from the Joint Intelligence Command in DIS said that DIS conducted the Critical Infrastructure Exercise known as CIDEX where experts understood how to handle threats to our digital infrastructure. MINDEF had also taken up initiatives such as two-way interactive videos, \u201cGuardians Of The City II\u201d card game and a book titled \u201cMy Little Red Dot\u201d to emphasise the importance of TD to people of all ages.\nThe world was now recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and after more than three years, life in Singapore was gradually returning to normal. Although Singapore had removed all remaining COVID-19 restrictions and lowered its disease outbreak response to the lowest level, SMS Zaqy Mohamad said that this achievement should not create a sense of satisfaction among the community, or cause them to take the efforts to strengthen resilience and maintain unity in the face of continuous uncertainty for granted. SMS Zaqy said that Singapore was not exempted from different threats, especially against the backdrop of world political unrest and deteriorating economic conditions. In recent years, cyberspace had transformed into a 'battlefield' as digital platforms and facilities were used as 'weapons' for the dissemination of false news or to create panic. In this regard, the DIS under the SAF had been established to strengthen Singapore's ability to face the increasingly dangerous threats in the virtual world. SMS Zaqy added that the uncertain future increased the need for Total Defence, which included six pillars of defence: military, social, civil, psychological, economic and digital.\nThe security environment as well as Singapore's unique weaknesses must be understood by every member of the society, to identify the best way to contribute towards maintaining peace and sovereignty. SMS Zaqy Mohamad said that Singapore's strongest defence, in facing various challenges, was the collective defence where people played their respective roles in addressing challenges. He added that this collective response included the contributions and hard work of the Malay\/Muslim community, and that Total Defence should be strengthened because they were responsible in \u2018maneuvering\u2019 Singapore through an uncertain future. SMS Zaqy said: \u201cThe pillars of Total Defence confirm our belief that the strong foundation for national defence is not only in the form of military, but requires a comprehensive response of all levels of society.\" He added: \u201cAlthough we cannot determine the future, a solid stronghold of Total Defence prepares the country and its citizens to face any challenges, whether to weather another pandemic or economic recession.\" SMS Zaqy also stressed the importance of the Digital Defence pillar.\nA commentary on the importance of being prepared and vigilant, which could prove to be life-saving written by Jared Ng. A report by the Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk in Nov 2022 showed that only 31 per cent of households in Singapore had a plan for what to do in the event of a disaster. As new technologies and capabilities emerged, it might be useful to consider what other platforms could complement Singapore\u2019s public warning system, to not only effectively disseminate warnings but inform residents on how to react. One reason why people might not take the siren wails seriously was because they were not cognisant of recent experiences of disaster, which lowered their perception of risks and dismiss the meaning attributed to Total Defence Day. Preparedness and vigilance against external threats had always been important and was the core message behind Total Defence Day, but it could be argued that it had never been more important than it was today. Having a better understanding of the threats, such as cyberattacks and climate change, that existed in and around Singapore took everyone one step closer to being prepared for them.",

Several lessons could be learned from disasters such as COVID-19 and the Turkey earthquake, such as preparation of disasters in peace times, people-first governance regardless of political landscape and international cooperation in times of disaster. Residential bomb shelters played the most important role in protecting human lives, as apart from wars, they could also save lives and wait for rescue when other disasters occurred. Despite the absence of natural disasters threatening Singapore, possible crises brought about by the changes in the earth's climate such as rising sea levels had to be taken into account. It was very important to prepare early and integrate various disaster prevention strategies and awareness into the education and training of youths. Every disaster relief operation to lend aid to foreign countries enabled Singapore to improve its capabilities, and more importantly, shoulder the responsibilities of being an international citizen.",

        "contentdescription":"The US Defense and Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) had announced that the US State Department had approved Singapore\u2019s request for a possible Foreign Military Sale of precision-guided air-to-ground munitions kits and related equipment and services. The estimated cost of the request was US$55 million (S$73.4 million), with the principal contractor being Raytheon Missile and Defense. If the sale was followed through, Singapore would use the bombs to add to its existing stockpile of similar weapons for equipping its fleet of Boeing F-15SG Eagle and Lockheed-Martin F-16C\/D Fighting Falcon multi-role fighters. The RSAF would also be a future operator of the Lockheed-Martin F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, with Singapore having selected the F-35B Short Take Off and Vertical Landing model in 2020. Singapore had been cleared to buy four F-35Bs with a further eight options that would be delivered starting from 2026, although it would likely seek more jets to replace its F-16s that would start being withdrawn from service around 2030. Singapore was also an important security partner of the US in the region, hosting up to four rotational Littoral Combat Ship deployments from Changi Naval Base, which also saw regular US Navy ship visits throughout the year.\u00a0(Australian Defence Magazine is an Australia-based news site.)",

Speaking about three other objects subsequently shot down over Alaska, north-west Canada and Lake Huron on the US-Canada border, Mr Biden said that the intelligence community believed they were \"most likely balloons tied to private companies, recreation or research institutions\" Mr Biden's remarks raised the possibility that the US used millions of dollars of military equipment against harmless, potentially handmade objects floated by enthusiasts.

        "contentdescription":"A team of Israeli contractors who claimed to have manipulated more than 30 elections around the world using hacking, sabotage and automated disinformation on social media had been exposed in a new investigation. The unit was run by Tal Hanan, a former Israeli special forces operative who now worked privately using the pseudonym \u201cJorge\u201d, and appeared to have been working under the radar in elections in various countries for more than two decades. He had been unmasked by an international consortium of journalists, and he and his unit, \u201cTeam Jorge\u201d, had been exposed by undercover footage and documents leaked to The Guardian. Hanan told undercover reporters that his services were available to intelligence agencies, political campaigns and private companies that wanted to secretly manipulate public opinion. Hanan appeared to have run at least some of his disinformation operations through an Israeli company, Demoman International, which was registered on a website run by the Israeli Ministry of Defence to promote defence exports, and the ministry did not respond to requests for comment. One of Team Jorge's key services was a sophisticated software package, Advanced Impact Media Solutions (AIMS) which controlled a vast army of fake social media profiles. Hanan and his team could gather intelligence on rivals and boasted of planting material in legitimate news outlets, which were then amplified by the AIMS bot-management software. Their bot-management software appeared to have grown significantly by 2022 and it controlled a multinational army of more than 30,000 avatars, complete with digital backstories that stretched back years. In addition to AIMS, Hanan told reports about his \u201cblogger machine\u201d - an automated system for creating websites that the AIMS-controlled social media profiles could then use to spread fake news across the internet. Hanan also demonstrated how access to Telegram could be manipulated to sow mischief, and said that some of his hacking methods exploited vulnerabilities in the global signaling telecoms system.\u00a0(The Guardian is a UK-based news site.)",

According to the source, the move apparently reflected that Tokyo wanted to put the US-developed long-range missiles into practical use as soon as possible to enhance Japan's deterrence, as it faced rapidly growing military threats from China and North Korea. In its three key defence documents updated in Dec 2022, the Japanese government vowed to possess what it called \u201ccounterstrike capabilities\u201d that allowed Japan to strike targets in enemy territory in case of emergency. The documents also said that Tomahawk missiles, which had a strike range of about 1,600km and would cover China\u2019s coastal areas, would be used to develop the counterstrike capabilities until Japan deployed home-developed ones. The Japanese government decided on a draft initial budget for fiscal year 2023 in Dec 2022, of which it would allocate \u00a5211.3 billion (S$2.12 billion) to procure the Tomahawks.\u00a0(The Japan Times is a Japan-based news site.)",

        "contentdescription":"According to GlobalData's recent report \"Malaysia Defense Market Size and Trends, Budget Allocation, Regulations, Key Acquisitions, Competitive Landscape and Forecast, 2022-2027\", Malaysia was accelerating the pace of its armament construction. Malaysia's defence spending was expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.3 per cent from 2022 to 2027. Malaysia's increased procurement and upgrade of military equipment was the epitome of the accelerated pace of military construction in the region.\u00a0 Malaysia had been focusing on economic development before and defence spending had not increased significantly, resulting in the delay or even cancellation of most of its military modernisation plans. Malaysia's defence expenditure had increased significantly by 8.4 per cent in 2023, and the defence expenditure in 2027 would reach US$5.2 billion (S$6.9 billion).\u00a0(People's Daily is a China-based news site.)",

        "contentdescription":"A commentary on the impact of the AUKUS nuclear submarine pact on Australia was written by Su-Lin Tan. After AUKUS was signed, \u201canti-AUKUS\u201d groups across Australian staged minor protests over Australia\u2019s use of nuclear capabilities, the prospect of being drawn into war, and being used to advance US defence and weapons manufacturing. The Independent and Peaceful Australia Network said that the AUKUS alliance would make Australia even more dependent on the US and less extricable from its wars. Australia\u2019s neighbours like Malaysia and Indonesia raised concerns that AUKUS might be a catalyst for a nuclear arms race in the region. Melissa Conley Tyler, an Australian foreign policy expert, said that a key issue for Australia in managing the AUKUS submarine announcement was how it would be received in the region, and Australia would need to message carefully that its aim was to promote stability and balance, rather than aggravate tensions.\u00a0(South China Morning Post is a Hong Kong-based news site.)",

        "contentdescription":"An editorial was written on the State of Southeast Asia Survey by the ISEAS \u2013 Yusof Ishak Institute. The survey revealed that heightened military tensions had emerged as a top-three concern for the region, tied at third place with widening socio-economic gaps and income disparity. China remained the undisputed economic power for Southeast Asia, as well as the most influential political and strategic entity, outpacing the US by significant, albeit reduced margins. At the same time, the ISEAS survey highlighted misgivings about China, with two-thirds of respondents expressing concern about its influence. Beijing, which had recently eased COVID-19 restrictions remained the most influential and strategic power in Southeast Asia but the percentage of those who so believe declined from the previous ISEAS survey. Southeast Asians, caught in the vortex of Big Power rivalry, were flagging concerns on everything from potential conflict over Taiwan hurting their societies to supply chain disruptions and travel restrictions affecting economies. New Delhi\u2019s refusal to side with the West on Russia, even as it criticised Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine, and its insistence on the QUAD being a provider of public goods rather than an instrument to squeeze China geopolitically, resonated with the region\u2019s own aspirations.",

The process included having the commander of the Public Shelter and Resilience Unit take over control of the station. Civilians entered the MRT station and once they were safely underground, automated blast doors would be activated to seal off the concourse level. The station also housed the water mains and an ultraviolet filter, two diesel generators, makeshift dry toilets, a decontamination area and an air filtration system to make sure that potable water, electricity and clean air were always available. During peacetime, the Public Shelter and Resilience Units conducted regular exercises to maintain readiness, while in a wartime emergency, these same units would conduct activities to educate the public on sheltering procedures.",

According to the DSCA statement, Singapore had requested to purchase 100 KMU-556 Tail Kits for the GBU-31 JDAM and 900 KMU-572 Tail Kits for GBU-38 JDAM and Laser GBU-54 JDAM. Singapore was also applying to purchase 250 MAU-169 Computer Control Group for 500 Pound Paveway II GBU-12 and 250 MXU-650 Air Foil Group for 500 Pound Paveway II GBU-12, and included a DSU-38 laser-guidance set and various other support and other training equipment in the purchase request.\u00a0(Defence Security Asia is a Malaysia-based alternative media site.)",

The issue of Taiwan might cause a physical confrontation, even if neither superpower wanted one. Moves by both sides could be seen as building up towards a war, such as recent US access to more bases in the Philippines and China\u2019s increased military presence in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait.

        "contentdescription":"According to the Commandant of the US Marine Corps GEN David Berger, the US Marine Corps (USMC) was considering expanding the use of loitering munitions, also known as suicide drones, in the Indo-Pacific region, which meant that such weapons could be used against Chinese warships in the event of a conflict in the Taiwan Strait.\u00a0 In Jan, the US and Japan agreed to reorganise the USMC in Okinawa and form a new Littoral Combat Regiment to defend Japan by 2025. GEN Berger said in an interview with Nikkei Asian Review that the mission of this force was where the risk of destabilisation and the national interests of the US and other countries were at risk, The report noted that this meant the scope of the new force's mission would not only defend Japan, but also included Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia On whether the Littoral Combat Group would fight on the front line in the event of a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, GEN Berger said \"I would say it is possible\" and added that the responsibilities of this force would be determined by the US Indo-Pacific Command. As for loitering munitions, GEN Berger said that attack drones could be effective against ships in the Indo-Pacific region and they could stay in the air for a period of time, violently hitting the target after identification, before exploding. GEN Berger added that loitering munitions would have a role to play in that in the future.",

        "contentdescription":"The US Air Force\u2019s F-35 fighter aircraft fleet suffered a massive decline in readiness rate and flight hours in 2022, according to a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\u00a0 The conventional take-off-and-landing F-35A variant saw the biggest fall in availability rates, from 65 per cent in 2021 to 54 per cent in 2022. The readiness of the jump-jet F-35B model also decreased by seven percentage points, from 61 per cent to 54 per cent. Only the F-35C saw an increase in availability, from 53 per cent in 2021 to 58 per cent in 2022. The CBO clarified that the age of all three variants may have affected their readiness. The majority of jets were also US Air Force F-35As, so sample sizes were small for the US Marine Corps\u2019 F-35Bs and the US Navy\u2019s F-35Cs. Since the beginning of 2020, an increasing number of F-35s had been unable to fly due to the lack of an operating engine. (The Defense Post is a US-based news site.)",
